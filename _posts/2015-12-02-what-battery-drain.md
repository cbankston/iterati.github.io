Due to an issue with my sleep code, Primer was draining approximately 0.28mA of power when sleeping. Thanks to help from Jonathan Tz and the great Ramiro Montes De Oca, it now drains about 0.27uA. That's 1000x less.

Pretty good power savings. Your batteries will love me. Occationally a button press will not register, and I'm still tracking down why this is the case, but it only happens maybe 1 in 10 presses so it shouldn't be too much of an issue, especially compared to how annoying the battery drain is.

So head on over to [Primer's home](/primer.html) and get it while it's hot.

Feels good to be back. Stay tuned for more exciting things.
